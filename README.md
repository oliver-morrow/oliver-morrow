# Hey! I'm Oliver
I am a second year computer engineering student at Queen's University, in Kingston ON Canada. I'm deeply interested in solving real-world problems and improving the lives of others. I also enjoy solving fun problems on the side and creating cool solutions to everyday problems. I mostly code in Python, C, JavaScript, and VHDL, but I pursue projects in many fields and in several other languages.
